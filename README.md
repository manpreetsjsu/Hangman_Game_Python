# Hangman_Game_Python
'''
A user is allowed 8 guesses. Make sure to remind the user of how many guesses s/he has left after each round. Assume that players will only
ever submit one character at a time (A-Z).

A user loses a guess only when s/he guesses incorrectly.

If the user guesses the same letter twice, do not take away a guess - instead, print a message letting them know they've already guessed 
that letter and ask them to try again.

The game should end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. If the player runs out of guesses (s/he "loses"), 
reveal the word to the user when the game ends.
